SI.V23.01: jun/2018
  - In 29/05/2018 James told us by an email sent to Fernando de Sá that the
    magnets that will be used as the fast correctors close to the BC magnet
    will have the shape of a normal quadrupole in the sections where there
    are the diagnostic beamlines. Hence it will not be possible to have skew
    quads there.

    sirius_si_family_data was changed so as to remove these 10 corrector skew quads just upstream
    BC, in those xxC2 straights where B2 diagnostic beamlines will be present.

SI.V22.04: may/2018
  - Update marker positions of diagnostics elements, according to allocation table in sirius wiki.

SI.V22.03: may/2018
  - Make SI.E22.02 the official version, since its impact of beam quality has
    been approved.
  - Updated location of tune picks. they had changed in Aug/2017 but the AT lattice has not been updated.

SI.E22.02: april/2018
   - Study of new spec of sextupole errors (multipole) based on bench measurements.
     (for details, see Luana's email of 2018-04-23 to ximenes)
     Multipole errors:

SI.V22.02: august/2017
   - New BC model 12

SI.V22.01: may/2017
   - The BPM upstream of dipole B2 was moved by 50mm (closer to B2) to fit in the girder. Modification in sectors C1 and C3. This change was requested by the Projects Group.

SI.V21.03: mar/2017
   - New fast corrector model 03.
   - Updated models of Q14, Q20, Q30 quadrupoles.
   - Updated model of sextupoles.
   - Updated models of B1 (model 09) and B2 (model 08).

SI.V21.02 - S05.03: mar/2017
   - A new operation mode (S05.03) has been created with symmetrized optics and same tunes and chromaticites as S05.01.

SI.V21.02 - S05.02: mar/2017
   - The new B1 and B2 models introduced non-zero dispersion at insertion straights as well as assymetries in the optical functions. The mode S05.02 is generated with symmetrized optics and sames tunes as S05.01. The horizontal chromaticity increased by ~ +4.5 and the emittance reduced to 0.248 nm.

SI.V21.02: feb/2017
   - New models for B1 (model-8) and B2 (model-7) are implemented.

SI.E21.01: jan/2017
   - Update in dipole models (B1 model 07, B2 model 08)
     (mechanical design approval still pending...)
   - Update in famnames according to new naming conventions
   - Add systematic multipoles for fast correctors CH, CV, QS (based on fieldmap analysis of corrector model 02)
   - Added fields in damily_data so that sys multi errors can be applied to
     CV/QS accoring to implementation in sextupoles or seprate magnets

SI.V21.01: oct/2016
   - Modifications proposed in SI.E20.01 are implemented oficialy.

SI.E20.01: set/2016
   - Study of the effect on residual orbit correction at BC due to modification of the BPM position from one side to the other side of the quadrupole. This modification avoids collision between BC beamline exit and the BPM. The fast corrector is transfered to the other side of the sextupole.

SI.V20.01: jul/2016.
   - (ago/2016) The FC (fast corrector) position in low beta matching sectors has been changed by 9 mm to avoid collision with quadrupole coils. Since this is change doesn't affect any of the calculations already performed, we kept the same version, SI.V20.01.
   - The extra sextupole magnet SDx4 has been removed and the stand-alone booster vertical corrector CV is returned. An additional coil is introduced in the fast corrector to generate the QS necessary to apply BBA in the BPM next to BC. A new family FCQ (fast correctors with QS coil) has been created.
   - FCQ is moved from the central region of the C2 sector to its extremity, close to dipole BC and the BPM.
   - The QS in sextupole SDx2 has been removed. The total number of QS is 100 in this version.

SI.E19.03: jul/2016.
    - Number of QS: 100 (as in SI.E19.01). The fast corretor in the middle of C2 is moved to the extremity close to BC. In this way the same magnet is used for FCH, FCV and QS.

SI.E19.02: jul/2016.
    - skew quads added to all fast correctors, QS of SDx0 removed. total: 150 QS

SI.E19.01: jul/2016.
    - QS of SDx2 in C4 sectors are removed. Total number of QS: 100

SI.V19: jun/2016.
    - AAn extra sextupole magnet SDx4 in straight C2 close to BC has been added to allow BBA in the BPM close to BC. Only the QS and CV coils are used, the main sextupole coils are not used. The stand-alone CV has been removed.

SI.V18: jun/2016. (current documented version - in progress).
    - QS coils are 'turned-on' in some sextupoles to allow for BBA in BPMs close to them: SDx2 in sector C1 and SDx3 in sector C3. x = A, B, P
    - Sextupoles containing QS and CH/CV in the matching cells of high beta sections (A) have been exchanged to allow BBA in the BPM close to SFA0. In summary, CH/CV moved to SDA0 and QS moved to SFA0.
    - For the low beta sections (B and P) the original configuration is preserved (that is CH/CV in SFB0/SFP0 and QS in SDB0/SDP0) since there are quadrupoles QDB2 close to the BPM.
    - The total number of QS in the ring increased from 80 to 120.

SI.V17: jun/2016.
    - Corrector CV and BPM next to BC moved away from it by 70 mm and 40 mm respectively.
    - Position of dipole kicker (DIPK) moved closer to nonlinear kicker NLK.

SI.V16: apr/2016.
    - Symmetry 5 optics with one high and three consecutive low beta function straight sections. There are 21 independent sextupole families.

SI.V15: apr/2016.
    - Symmetry 5 optics with one high and three consecutive low beta function straight sections. There are 28 independent sextupole families.

SI.V14: dec/2015
    - Default sextupole strengths and optics mode has moved to C03, making the dynamics more robust to ID perturbations.
    - The distance between dipole B1 and quadrupoles QDB1 and QDA (in the matching section) has been increased by 10 cm to allow moving the pumping station from B1B upstream to downstream.
    - To keep the same ring circumference, the long straight sections have been reduced by the same amount.
    - Fast correctors at the injection and RF cavity straight sections have been restored. In this way, all straight sections are the same regarding fast correctors.

SI.V13: oct/2015.
    - A new BC magnet design with a physical length of 912.52 mm (with end-plates). High field region is narrower in this new design.
    - injection point has moved due to new transfer line TS.V02. On-axis kicker and PMM moved as well. Lattice BPMs are kept in injection straight section (in version V12 they were removed).
    - Fast correctors at the injection and RF cavity straight sections have been removed
    - Default optics mode C02 is optimized with Insertion Devices included to avoid 4-th order resonance that shows up and that was reducing the beam long-term stability.
    - (modelling) Also systematic multipoles from fieldmap analysis of the 3D magnet model have been added to the nominal lattice model.
    - (modelling) In the model all magnet lengths were truncated to multiples of millimeters.

SI.V12: oct/2015.
    - New slow correction system so that orbit may be better corrected at radiation exits. The modifications are:
    - All radiation source points, comprising ID straights and BC dipoles, are now surrounded by BPMs, there is no longer any magnetic element from the lattice between the BPM and the light source point.
    - A BPM from the C2 section has been removed, decreasing the total number of BPMs in the ring by 20 units, from 180 to 160.
    - A vertical corrector has been added before BC, next to it. This corrector can be of the Booster CV type since it has the same maximum strength specification. In total there are 20 of these correctors in the ring.
    - Another extra vertical corrector coil combined with the sextupole SF2 in sector C3 has been added. This sextupole, which had only CH before, will now have CH and CV coils.
    - The total number of vertical corrector power supplies has increased by 40 in this new version, from 120 to 160. The number of horizontal correctors remains the same, 120.
    - The fast corrector positions have changed according to the new arrangement of BPMs.
    - The sextupoles SF2J and SF2K were displaced by a small amount to allow placing the fast correctors closer to BC.

SI.V10: jun/2015.
    - Change in the straight sections: QDA/QDB1 changed positions with SDA/SDB sextupoles; QDB2 brought closer to QFB; longer straight sections (6.5/7.5m).
    - New Q14, Q20 and Q30 models (different physical lengths and systematics multipoles).
    - Change of sextupole family names: from sd1/sf1/sd2/sd3/sf2/sd6/sf4/sd5/sd4/sf3 to sd1j/sf1j/sd2j/sd3j/sf2j/sd1k/sf1k/sd2k/sd3k/sf2k.
    - The number of horizontal correctors used in the correction loop was diminished to 120. Now the sextupoles with correctors are: CH --> sd1j/sf2j/sd1k/sf2k/sfa/sfb | CV --> sd1j/sd3j/sd1k/sd3k/sfa/sfb.

SI.V09: jun/2015.
    - The magnets B3 and BC were redesigned into a single permanent magnet, named BC. The central field changed from 2T to 3.2T.
    - Few BPMs were moved: the BPMs on the straights were moved to the other side of the focalizing quadrupole, due to request of the vacuum group; the BPM close to the B1 dipole was moved to be close to the B2 dipole.

SI.V08: mar/2015.
    - Skew quadrupole correctors moved from sextupole to fast correctors magnets.

SI.V07: mar/2015.
    - Small dislocations in sextupoles and quadrupoles. Circumference pinned to 518.396 m. Fast correctors CHF and CVF moved out from sextupole magnets. New MOGA optimization adopted (firstRun_000493.m).
    - Skew quadrupole correctors in SDA, SF1, SF4 and SDB sextupole families. New BC model with 12 segments being used.

SI.V06: fev/2015.
    - Length of quadrupoles: 14 cm, 20 cm and 30 cm.

SI.V05: fev/2015.
    - The length of the quadrupoles are changed as follows: from 25 cm and 14 cm to 20 cm; from 34 cm to 25 cm.

SI.V04: fev/2015.
    - In this version the model for dipoles B1, B2 and B3 have been changed to reflect the decision to use rectangular straight unit blocks to composed them.
    - Each dipole magnetic length considers 396 mm blocks, 7 mm spacing between blocks and 29 mm gap. Note that the entrance and exit angle for all dipoles are now the same.
    - The BC deflection is increased from 1.4 to 1.468 degrees, according to the magnet model. B1 uses 2 blocks, B2 uses 3 blocks and B3 uses 1 block.

SI.V03: set/2014.
    - Corretoras H e V estão juntas. Retirado um bpm (saída do B3) por trecho. Redefinidas onde as corretoras rápidas ficarão.

SI.V02: set/2014.
    - QFA passou de 34 cm para 25 cm. Ajustes na distância SEXT-QUAD. Corretoras aumentadas de 10 cm para 12 cm incluindo bobina. BPMs ao lado do B3 reposicionados para perto dos quadrupolos QF4 para otimizar BBA.

SI.V01: ago/2014.
    - Familias de sextupolos no arco cromático foi separada: famílias antes do BC ficaram independentes das famílias depois do BC, ou seja não temos mais simetria de espelho para os sextupolos em relação ao BC.

SI.V00: ago/2014.
    - Esta é a mesma versão que a v500. Reniciamos a numeração das versões.

SI.V500: nov/2013.
    - Comprimento dos trechos retos ajustados para freqüência de RF de 499.654MHz. A circunferência passou de 518.25m para 518.396m. Aumento de 2 x 0,00365m nos trechos retos de inserção LIA e LIB.

    - A partr dela, fizemos a v400, que ainda possui três alterações: alguns sextupolos foram deslocados 1.5cm para mais perto do quadrupolo mais próximo, para padronizar as distâncias entre elementos em inteiros de cm;
    - as corretoras que estavam juntas foram separadas, e as corretoras simetrizadas em relação ao BC, apesar de os bpms não serem simétricos;
