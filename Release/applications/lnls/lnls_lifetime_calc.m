% lnls_calc_total_lifetime: calculates each contribution for the total
% lifetime (quantum, elastic, inelastic and Touschek). For the Touschek
% lifetime it takes the effect of IBS into account. For the elastic and
% inelastic lifetimes it was used a simulated pressure profile with
% accumulated charge of 10000Ah and considering the effect of delta
% undulator radiation. Data file is "Pressure_Profile.txt".
%
% Input - ring: ring model
%         ph: set the operational phase (0, 1 or 2)
%         I: Beam Current [mA] (Default: current per bunch, Nb = 1, but  
%    if Nb is different from 1, input must be total beam current and uniform 
%    fill will be considered)
%         Nb (Optional) = Number of bunches (harmonic number) Default: 1 
%         K  (Optional) = Coupling [decimal] (Default = 0.03); 
% 
% Output - lifetime: struct with each component of lifetime in hours
%          total: value of total lifetime [h]
%
% Notes:
% - lnls_refine_lattice was used setting 5cm as the maximum value for
% elements lenght and then calculations of twiss function for this refined
% lattice were made with atsummary
% - sirius_pressure_profile_2018: check if the pressure profile is the
% newest one
% - Pressure and Acceptance were calculated with lattice model SI.V22.04
